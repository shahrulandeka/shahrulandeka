<h1>Hi, I'm Shahrul! <br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shahrulandeka/">Cybersecurity Professional</a>

<h2>🔭 Brief Summary</h2>

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio! Where I comprehensively document everything that I do, and label it as practical experience! I realize how tough it is to get an entry-level job when I have zero work experience. So I decided to take on practical projects and labs works to showcase that I can do the job and add value to my prospective company.
